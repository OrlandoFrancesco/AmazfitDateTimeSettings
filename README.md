# What the app does

This is a very simple app that makes it possible to change the date and time of your watch without using the Zepp app.
In addition to manually setting the time and date, it is also possible to do it automatically through the [WorldTimeApi](https://worldtimeapi.org/) which returns a series of information via the IP of the network to which you are connected.

## Some screens here

The screens are in italian because.. hey! Iâ€™m italian!

At this moment only english and italian are supported.

As you can see, there are very few entries so it will be very easy to translate the app into other languages.

# Requirements

You need an unlocked and rooted watch.

This app uses `android.permission.SET_TIME` permission that is an Android system permission that allows an application to directly set the system time. This permission is at the signature|privileged level, which means it can only be granted to an application signed with the same signing certificate as the operating system or to an application that has been installed as a system app.

My watch is currently not unlocked, in fact the tests were done on another device.

To unlock and root the watch follow the instructions below.

# How to unlock and root

Coming soon.
